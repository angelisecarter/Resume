        <p>I have many gaming consoles, maybe too many.  But they all seem to have different purposes.  Here's my list of the consoles I still use, and the games I like.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                Playstation 5 <br />
                Best for solo gaming.  <br />
                Play with others online but when I'm the only one playing at home and I want to get serious gaming with superior graphics, this is it!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Meta Quest 2<br />
                Best VR experience.  <br />
                I use this more for puzzle games and working out.  The fitness games can you give you a great workout.  Beat Saber anyone?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Nintendo Switch <br />
                Best for gaming with kids.  <br />
                Lots of great games for kids once they get the hang of using a controller. You can even get an augmented reality race car to play along. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                XBox 360 <br />
                Best hands-free experience<br />
                I still use this console mainly for dancing games.  It's nice to not have to hold any controllers.  The newer Xbox is definitely a rival to PlayStation but I prefer the PS games ecosystem.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Wii<br />
                Best for gaming with young kids or adults that don't game<br />
                Kids that are too young to work a controller will find this super easy to use.  It's an older console so the graphic so don't expect up-to-date graphics.
                </p>

                Playstation 5: Marvel Avengers <br />
                Not hardcore gaming but what I'm playing now.  It's fun and you can set the difficulty, which is always nice.<br/>
                Lots of side missions too so you can get your money's worth.  I always love playing as a superhero.

                Meta Quest 2: The Room <br />
                If you like escape rooms and solving puzzles then this is for you!<br />
                The graphics on this game are fantastic.  And it's challenging but not to the point of frustration.  My only complaint is that it was too short.

                Nintendo Switch: KeyWe <br />
                I wasn't sure about this when I bought it but it has been a lot of fun with my kid.<br />
                In co-op mode, you are two little birds trying to beat the clock and finish your tasks.  Great for learing to work together.

                XBox 360: Michael Jackson Experience <br />
                Still the best dance game for me.<br />
                The music is awesome of course and it's a lot of fun trying to do his moves.

            <li>
                <p>
                Wii:  Sports Resort<br />
                No previous experience with gaming needed to play and a great variety of games to compete with your friends.<br />
                Test your skills with Wakeboarding, Frisbee, Archery, and more.  It's all about the technique.
